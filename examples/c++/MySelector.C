#define MySelector_cxx
// The class definition in MySelector.h has been generated automatically
// by the ROOT utility TTree::MakeSelector(). This class is derived
// from the ROOT class TSelector. For more information on the TSelector
// framework see $ROOTSYS/README/README.SELECTOR or the ROOT User Manual.

// The following methods are defined in this file:
//    Begin():        called everytime a loop on the tree starts,
//                    a convenient place to create your histograms.
//    SlaveBegin():   called after Begin(), when on PROOF called only on the
//                    slave servers.
//    Process():      called for each event, in this function you decide what
//                    to read and fill your histograms.
//    SlaveTerminate: called at the end of the loop on the tree, when on PROOF
//                    called only on the slave servers.
//    Terminate():    called at the end of the loop on the tree,
//                    a convenient place to draw/fit your histograms.
//
// To use this file, try the following session on your Tree T:
//
// Root > T->Process("MySelector.C")
// Root > T->Process("MySelector.C","some options")
// Root > T->Process("MySelector.C+")

   // keyed object in the case of PROOF) to be processed. The entry argument
   // specifies which entry in the currently loaded tree is to be processed.
   // It can be passed to either TTree::GetEntry() or TBranch::GetEntry()
   // to read either all or the required parts of the data. When processing
   // keyed objects with PROOF, the object is already loaded and is available
   // via the fObject pointer.
   //
   // This function should contain the "body" of the analysis. It can contain
   // simple or elaborate selection criteria, run algorithms on the data
   // of the event and typically fill histograms.

   // WARNING when a selector is used with a TChain, you must use
   //  the pointer to the current TTree to call GetEntry(entry).
   //  The entry is always the local entry number in the current tree.
   //  Assuming that fChain is the pointer to the TChain being processed,
   //  use fChain->GetTree()->GetEntry(entry).
